# Tabular-Classification
A tabular classification project was conducted to determine a bankâ€™s member retention based on the bank's historical data.

The two models that were utilized were the Random Forest Classifier in Scikit-Learn and an Artificial Neural Network (one utilizing Keras/Tensorflow and the other with Fast.ai/Pytorch).
